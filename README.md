# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose & Overview
The motive for this project is to make use of unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and prepare a analyze report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified based on their features.
This classification groups created by this project can be used by an Investor, Banks and their clients to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio.
The following methods were used for the analysis:
<li>Preprocessing the database</li>
<li>Bring down the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis</li>
<li>Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means</li>
<li>Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots</li>
